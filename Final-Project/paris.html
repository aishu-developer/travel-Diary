    cityscape is crisscrossed by wide boulevards and the River Seine. Beyond such landmarks as the Eiffel Tower and the 12th-century, 
    Gothic Notre-Dame cathedral, the city is known for its cafe culture and designer boutiques along the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré.

     <li id="subpoint">Eiffel Tower</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        Built by Gustave Eiffel to commemorate the centenary of the French Revolution, it is presented at the Exposition Universelle in 
        Paris in 1889. 324 meters high, it is one of the most visited monuments in the world with nearly 7 million visitors a year.The 
        first floor houses the Eiffel Tower 58 which extends over two levels, 58 meters above the ground as its name suggests. On the 
        second floor, the view is the best at 115 meters because you have a diving view on the ground below. Finally on the 3rd floor 
        at 275 meters, you can see what the office of Gustave Eiffel was. For the more adventurous one, it is possible to use the stairs
        and climb the steps (1,665 to the summit).The ascent of the Eiffel Tower is a must to enjoy the magnificent view of Paris.

     <li id="subpoint">Notre Dame Cathedral</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        One of the most enduring symbols of Paris: Notre-Dame de Paris, also known as Notre Dame, a Roman Catholic cathedral is located on 
        the eastern half of the Ile de la Cité. It is widely considered one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture in France 
        and Europe. Begun in 1163 and completed in 1345, this cathedral is a sight with its portals surrounded by his many sculptures and 
        gargoyles that adorn the roof.We advise you to walk around the cathedral, then go inside and climb the 387 steps to the top of the 
        towers. The climb to the top of the towers can be exhausting, but you will get a panoramic view of the region and see the famous 
        gargoyles up close.

     <li id="subpoint">Champs Elysées / Arc of Triumph</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        Under the spell of ancient Roman architecture, Napoleon commissioned Jean Chalgrin the design of a triumphal arch dedicated to the glory of
        imperial armies. Built in the 19th century, it is the largest monument of its kind in the world. Impressive sculptures adorn its pillars. 
        In addition, the names of 558 generals and the great victories are engraved on the top of the arc. Under the Arc de Triomphe is the Tomb of 
        the Unknown Soldier of France.The panoramic terrace above the door offers a beautiful view of Paris. 50 meters high, 45 meters wide and 22 
        meters deep, the Arc de Triomphe is located on the Place de l'Etoile which leads to the Champs Elysees which is nicknamed "the most beautiful 
        avenue in the world." It stands on 1.9 km between Place de la Concorde and the Arc de Triomphe.
