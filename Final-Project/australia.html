   <h1 class="h2-desc">AUSTRALIA-THE SPECTACULAR BEAUTY</h1>
   <p class="desc">
     Australia is a land of dreams. From the sacred legends of the aboriginal Dreamtime, when the great spirits conjured 
     the coral reefs, rainforests, and scorched red deserts, to armchair travelers who describe Australia as their dream
     destination, the Land Down Under deserves all the hype. The world's smallest continent and largest island, Australia 
     is almost the same size as the United States but with a population the size of New York State and some of the
     quirkiest wildlife on the planet.

   <p class="desc">
     Australia is also a land of staggering contrasts and spectacular beauty. Along the coast, you can explore vibrant
     multicultural cities, vast sand islands, ancient rainforests, and one of the planet's most awe-inspiring natural
     wonders - the Great Barrier Reef. In the Outback, rugged national parks and red-earthed deserts offer the ultimate 
     in adventure travel. Top it all off with a laid-back feel and friendly people, and it's no wonder Australia scores 
     top billing on bucket lists around the world. Create your own adventure with our list of the top attractions in
     Australia:

     <li id="subpoint">Sydney Opera House</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
         "Sydney, Australia" and most people think of the Opera House. Shaped like huge shells or billowing sails, this 
         famous building on Sydney's Bennelong Point graces the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is one of the 
         world's great architectural icons. The location is stunning. Water surrounds the structure on three sides, and 
         the Royal Botanic Gardens border it to the south.Danish architect, Jørn Utzon won an international competition 
         for its design but withdrew from the project after technical and financing problems. Construction was finally 
         completed in 1973 at a cost ten times the original budget. By this time, Utzon had left the country never 
         returning to see his magnificent creation.

        <p id="s-desc">
        One of the best sites to photograph the Opera House is Mrs Macquarie's Chair in the Royal Botanic Gardens, or you 
        can hop aboard a harbor cruise or ferry for yet another picturesque perspective.

     <li id="subpoint">Great Barrier Reef Marine Park</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        Visible from outer space, the World Heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef is one of the largest living structures 
        on the planet. In 1975, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park was established to protect its fragile ecosystems, 
        which include more than 3,000 coral reefs; 600 continental islands, including the beautiful Whitsunday group; 
        300 coral cays; and inshore mangrove islands. One of the seven wonders of the natural world, the park stretches 
        for 2,300 kilometers along the state of Queensland, on Australia's east coast (that's about the distance between 
        Mexico and Vancouver). Diving and snorkeling are spectacular.
       </p>
       <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/gr.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
       <p id="s-desc">
         The astounding array of marine life includes soft and hard corals, more than 1,600 species of tropical fish, 
         sharks, dugongs, dolphins, turtles, rays, and giant clams. If you prefer to stay dry, you can see the reef from 
         underwater viewing stations and glass bottom boats. On the mainland, Cairns, Port Douglas, and Airlie Beach are 
         the main launching points for tours.

     <li id="subpoint"> Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        Deep in the heart of Australia's Red Centre, Uluru (formerly Ayers Rock), is one of the most photographed natural 
        wonders in the country. The striking red monolith forms the centerpiece of Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, a World 
        Heritage Area jointly managed by Parks Australia and the traditional landowners, the Aṉangu people. 
       </p>
       <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/ul.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
       <p id="s-desc">
        Uluru, meaning "shadowy place" in the local aboriginal dialect, rises to a height of 348 meters from the surrounding 
        plain, with most of its bulk hidden beneath the earth's surface. Also in the park are the red dome-shaped rocks 
        called Kata Tjuta (the Olgas). As the sun dips in the sky, sightseers gather to watch the colors of Uluru and Kata 
        Tjuta transform in the shifting light. A great way to appreciate these sacred sites is to join a tour led by 
        Aboriginal guides and rangers.

     <li id="subpoint">Sydney Harbour Bridge</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        Along with the Opera House, the Sydney Harbour Bridge is one of Australia's most famous tourist attractions. 
        Affectionately called "the Coathanger," this impressive feat of construction is the largest steel arch bridge in the 
        world. It was completed in 1932, 40 years before the Sydney Opera House. Rising 134 meters above the harbor, the 
        bridge spans 500 meters, connecting Sydney's North Shore to the central business district. In addition to the 
        pedestrian path, two railway lines extend over the bridge, as well as eight lanes for road traffic, and the direction 
        of each lane can be switched to accommodate traffic flow.
       </p>
       <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/sy.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
       <p id="s-desc">
        One of the top things to do in Sydney is a guided ascent to the top of the bridge, where you can enjoy spectacular 
        views over the harbor and city. For an overview on the bridge's history and construction visit the museum in the 
        southeastern pier. Interestingly, Paul Hogan, of Crocodile Dundee fame, worked as a painter on the bridge before 
        rocketing to international stardom.

     <li id="subpoint">Blue Mountains National Park</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        A UNESCO World Heritage Site, beautiful Blue Mountains National Park lies 81 kilometers west of Sydney and is a 
        popular day trip from the city. Named for the blue haze emanating from the many eucalyptus trees, this stunning 
        park protects more than 664,000 acres of wilderness and encompasses dramatic gorges, waterfalls, aboriginal rock 
        paintings, and 140 kilometers of hiking trails. The most famous attractions in the park are the towering 
        sandstone rock formations called the Three Sisters.
       </p>
       <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/blue.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
       <p id="s-desc">
        Other highlights include the Katoomba Scenic Railway, the world's steepest, which whisks passengers down the 
        Jamison Valley through a cliff-side tunnel into an ancient rainforest, and the Skyway, Scenic Cableway, and 
        Scenic Walkway, which all offer elevated views of the dense forests. Hiking, abseiling, rock climbing, mountain 
        biking, and horseback riding are all popular things to do in the park.

     <li id="subpoint">Melbourne</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        Melbourne, Australia's second largest city, is a popular stop on many Australian itineraries - especially for culture 
        vultures. Galleries, theaters, restaurants, shops, and its distinctly European feel are the main draws of this 
        sophisticated city on the Yarra River. It's also a green city, with parks, gardens, and open spaces occupying almost
        a third of its total area. Highlights of the city include the Royal Botanic Gardens; Federation Square; the National 
        Gallery of Victoria; and the Melbourne Cricket Ground, where sports fans can watch cricket in the summer and 
        Australian Rules football in the winter. Shoppers flock to the elegant Royal Arcade on Bourke Street, as well as 
        Chapel Street; the Melbourne Central Shopping Center; and the Queen Victoria Market, which has been selling fruits,
        vegetables, clothes, and crafts for more than a century.
       </p>

       <p id="s-desc">
        To the east, greater Melbourne extends into the beautiful Dandenong Ranges, and in the south to the Mornington 
        Peninsula, where many locals escape for day trips and seaside getaways.

     <li id="subpoint">Bondi Beach</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        Bronzed bodies, blond sand, backpackers, and surf - throw it all together and you get one of the world's most
        famous beaches. Only 15 minutes by car from the city center, Bondi Beach is home to one of the oldest surf life
        saving clubs in the world. It's also a great spot for a seaside stroll or picnic, and crowds of tourists and
        locals gather here to celebrate Christmas and ring in the New Year. A great way to soak up the sea views is to 
        stroll along the scenic Bondi to Bronte coastal walk, which begins at the southern end of the beach and follows 
        the coastline for six kilometers along sandstone cliffs. Shops, cafes, and restaurants lie across the street from
        this famous coastal strip. Other attractions around the beach include the Sunday markets, ocean pool, and skate
        park. Take care when swimming at Bondi. Strong rip tides often sweep unsuspecting swimmers out to sea, especially
        at the southern end of this kilometer-long strand, so swimmers should stay between the flags. There's a reason the 
        Aussies made a reality TV show called Bondi Rescue.
