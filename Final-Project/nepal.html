   <h1 class="h2-desc">NEPAL-THE ULTIMATE OUTDOOR DESTINATION</h1>
   <p class="desc">
    Nepal s a landlocked country located in South Asia. It is mainly situated in the Himalayas, but also includes parts 
    of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, bordering Tibet of China to the north, and India in the south, east, and west, while it
    it is narrowly separated from Bangladesh by the Siliguri Corridor, and from Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim. 
    Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten
    tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, 
    multi-religious and multi-cultural state, with Nepali as the official language. Kathmandu is the nation's capital 
    and the largest city.

   <ul class="cities">
     <li id="subpoint">Kathmandu</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        Kathmandu, Nepal's capital, is set in a valley surrounded by the Himalayan mountains. At the heart of the old
        cityâ€™s mazelike alleys is Durbar Square, which becomes frenetic during Indra Jatra, a religious festival featuring 
        masked dances. Many of the city's historic sites were damaged or destroyed by a 2015 earthquake. Durbar Square's
        palace, Hanuman Dhoka, and Kasthamandap, a wooden Hindu temple, are being rebuilt. 
       </p>
       <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/kat.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
        <p id="s-desc">
        The highlight of Kathmandu has long been Durbar Square, the largest of the palace squares in the three royal
        cities and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Temples and monuments of varying shapes, sizes, styles, and faiths can
        be found here.
       </p>
     </li>  

     <li id="subpoint"> Bhaktapur</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        Bhaktapur, the third of the "Royal Cities," lies on the old trade route to Tibet, just outside of Kathmandu. For
        Bhaktapur, the trade route was both an arterial link and major source of wealth. Its relative remoteness at the 
        time allowed the city to develop independently and in ways which distinguish it from the other two cities.
       </p>
       <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/bha.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
       <p id="s-desc">
        In contrast to Patan and Kathmandu, the population of Bhaktapur is primarily Hindu. The best place from which to
        begin a tour of the city is Durbar Square, where in addition to the royal palace, several temples are also
        situated. The whole area is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
       </p>
     </li>  

     <li id="subpoint">Boudhanath Stupa (Bodhnath)</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        The Bodhanath Stupa, just outside Kathmandu, is one of the largest stupas of its kind in the world and dates to 
        some time around the 6th century, possibly even earlier. Like Bhaktapur, it lies on the old trade route to Tibet
        and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
       </p>
       <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/bu.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
       <p id="s-desc">
        The stupa itself is a symbol of enlightenment but at Boudhanath the symbolism is particularly clear. Each 
        different shape represents one of the five elements, earth, water, fire, air, and sphere, which are also the 
        attributes of the five Buddhas. Brought together in the form of the stupa, their unity reflects in abstract 
        fashion the structure of the universe itself.The stupa sustained minor damage during the 2015 earthquake and 
        is now fully repaired.
       </p>
     </li>  

     <li id="subpoint">Pokhara</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        Set at the base of the foothills and surrounded by some of the highest mountains in the world - Dhaulagiri, 
        Manaslu, and Annapurna I - Pokhara is one of Nepal's most scenic cities. For trekkers, Pokhara is the gateway
         to the Himalayas and the starting point for treks to Jomsom and the Annapurna region. It's also a wonderful 
         spot to relax for a bit, either before or after a hiking trip.
       </p>
       <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/po.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
       <p id="s-desc">
        By population, it is the second largest city in Nepal after Kathmandu but still does not feel like a big city. 
        As you travel from Kathmandu, 200 kilometers to the east, you'll notice the much cleaner air and pleasant climate
        almost immediately. Lake Phewa, with its cluster of lakeside hotels, restaurants, and shops, is ideal for those
        looking for a little relaxation.
       </p>
     </li>  
     
     <li id="subpoint">Trekking in the Annapurna Region</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        The Annapurna Region is one of the most popular trekking regions in Nepal, with options that range from a few days to a few weeks. Three
        main routes in the Annapurna Region intersect and combine in places, and you can opt to do a portion or a 
        variation on the routes. The routes are well marked and easy to follow.The Annapurna Circuit around Annapurna
        Mountain takes about 21 days to complete and is incredibly popular with people who have enough time. This route
        is sometimes called the "Apple Pie Circuit," in reference to the fact that most of the teahouses along the route
        serve their own version of fried apple pie.
       </p>
       <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/po.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
       <p id="s-desc">
        In many regards, the Annapurna Region, north of Pokhara, is an ideal walking area. The dramatic contrasts of the
        Nepalese countryside are especially visible, from the subtropical vegetation of the Pokhara Valley to the dry rain
        shadow area, with features of the Tibetan plateau. The people and cultures are also very different: facial 
        characteristics, food, houses, lifestyles, customs, and religion.
       </p>
     </li>  

     <li id="subpoint">Chitwan National Park</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        Chitwan National Park is the place to come to experience a different side of Nepal. This is a wonderful place for
        wildlife viewing and it has a safari-type atmosphere. At an altitude of only 100 meters in some areas, much lower 
        than Kathmandu at 1,400 meters, Chitwan has a tropical monsoon climate, quite different than what you'd expect to 
        find in Nepal.Travelers come here to see wildlife. The park is home to rhinos, Bengal tigers, leopards, sloth
        bears, gaur (buffalo), deer, and many other critters. Freshwater dolphins (gangetic) and crocodiles inhabit the 
        rivers and streams but are rarely seen. More than 500 species of birds make Chitwan a paradise for ornithologists. 
        Tours from the lodges take you out into the park, either on foot, or more often, on elephants for close-up views of
        the animals.
       </p>
       <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/po.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
       <p id="s-desc">
        The best time to visit Chitwan is from October to February. Average temperatures hover around 25 degrees Celsius
        (77 degrees Fahrenheit), with high humidity, although the mornings can be quite cool. June to September is the
        monsoon season, with frequent and heavy rain.
