   <h1 class="h2-desc">FAMOUS MALAYSIA</h1>
   <p class="desc">
     Malaysia is a Southeast Asian country occupying parts of the Malay Peninsula and the island of Borneo. It's 
     known for its beaches, rainforests and mix of Malay, Chinese, Indian and European cultural influences. The 
     capital, Kuala Lumpur, is home to colonial buildings, busy shopping districts such as Bukit Bintang and 
     skyscrapers such as the iconic, 451m-tall Petronas Twin Towers.

   <ul class="cities">
     <li id="subpoint">Petronas Twin Towers, Kuala Lumpur</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        The tallest twin towers in the world, the Petronas reach an impressive 452 meters high up into the clouds. The 
        towers are 88 floors tall and have an impressive total of 76 elevators.Built using reinforced concrete, steel, 
        and glass, the two towers are connected to each other by a double skybridge on the 41st and 42nd floors. 
        Visitors can make their way up here for stunning views of KL and the 6.9-hectare KLCC Park below—the views 
        are particularly impressive at night.
       </p>
       <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/unn.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
        <p id="s-desc">
        While most of the floors on the towers are rented to companies—IBM, Microsoft, and Huawei Technologies all have 
        offices here—the bottom floors of the towers are reserved for Suria KLCC, one of the largest shopping centers 
        in Malaysia. With over 300 stores, an art gallery, and even space for a Philharmonic Hall, this retail and 
        entertainment space will keep visitors occupied for hours.
       </p>

     <li id="subpoint">Batu Caves, Selangor</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        Located less than an hour outside Kuala Lumpur, the Batu Caves complex consists of three main caves plus a 
        series of smaller ones, most of them containing statues and 100-year-old shrines dedicated to Hindu gods.
       </p>
       <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/gor.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
       <p id="s-desc">
        The main cave, known as Cathedral Cave, is at the top of a massive colorful staircase—make it all the way up 
        the 272 steps, and you'll find a space decorated with statues, altars, and lights. At the bottom of the stairs,
         a 43-meter-tall gold statue of Lord Murugan welcomes visitors.Visitors are allowed to explore the caves on 
         their own or can join a guided tour to learn more about the caves. During the Hindu festival of Thaipusam 
         in January, thousands of people flock to the cave for the celebrations.

     <li id="subpoint">Mount Kinabalu, Sabah</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        At just over 4,000 meters high, Mount Kinabalu is the tallest mountain in Malaysia. The mountain is part of 
        Kinabalu Park, one of the oldest national parks in Malaysia and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Because of its 
        unique ecosystem mixing alpine meadows, grasslands, and shrublands, Kinabalu is home to an impressive range of 
        both plant and animal species, including the threatened orangutans.
       </p>
       <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/sab.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
       <p id="s-desc">
        Mount Kinabalu is a major destination for climbers—but summiting here can be tricky. Only 185 climb permits are 
        issued daily by the park, and visitors must make accommodation reservations and hire a mountain guide in advance 
        in order to be allowed to hit the trails. Although people under 16 are allowed to join climbing groups, there are 
        restrictions in place.Climbers should plan a stay at the Kinabalu National Park before attempting the climb—
        since the park itself is already at an altitude of over 1,800 meters, this will allow for acclimatization before
        attempting to reach the peak.

     <li id="subpoint">Perhentian Islands</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        Once a stopping point used by traders traveling around Southeast Asia, this group of small islands is part of 
        a marine park and has become a major tourist destination in northeastern Malaysia. Most of the islands can be 
        accessed by either ferry or small motorized boats, although only the two larger islands offer accommodations, 
        shops, and amenities—of these two, Pulau Perhentian Besar has more of a backpacking scene, while Pulau Perhentian
         Kecil is a little more upscale and family-oriented.
       </p>
       <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/is.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
       <p id="s-desc">
        While you can hop on a water taxi to move from one beach to the next here, it's also possible to follow the 
        island's walking trails instead—a much-recommended option as you get to trek through jungle paths and get open 
        stunning views of the water along the way.Scuba diving, snorkeling, and kayaking are popular activities here, 
        but visitors can also volunteer in turtle conservation programs and get unique access to the areas where 
        turtles come to lay eggs.
       </p>
     </li>  

     <li id="subpoint">Sipadan Island</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        Sipadan Island and its surrounding ocean waters are part of the world's richest marine habitat, home to 
        endangered hawksbill turtles, whale sharks, monitor lizards, and hundreds of coral species. The island is also 
        considered one of the best diving destinations in the world and is fiercely protected—visiting requires a 
        permit in advance and only 120 permits are given out per day.Reaching the island requires an hour-long ride on 
        a speed boat. Once here, the island can be easily explored on foot, with different beaches and reef sites within 
        minutes of each other.
       </p>
       <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/sip.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
       <p id="s-desc">
        Since it's no longer possible to stay on the island because of environmental protection laws (the nearby Mabul 
        Island offers accommodations), visitors usually come here early in the morning as part of snorkeling and diving
         tours. All visitors must leave the island by 3pm.
       </p>

     <li id="subpoint">Gunung Mulu National Park, Sarawak</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        This UNESCO World Heritage Site might be more famous for its impressive karst limestone pinnacles that 
        resemble people standing in large formations, but the park's massive caves are just as stunning.Thick rain 
        forest covers most of the park and makes some areas difficult to access—one of the reasons some of the caves 
        here weren't really explored until the 1970s. Another reason is how massive the cave systems are: both the 
        largest passage and the largest underground chamber in the world are located in caves here.
       </p>
       <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/mulu.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
       <p id="s-desc">
        Deer Cave is particularly beautiful, with ceilings over 122 meters tall, waterfalls cascading through the rocks,
         and an opening over a sinkhole that's over one kilometer wide. Visitors to the park can also trek up to the 
         Sarawak Chamber and Paku Waterfall or try a climb up on The Pinnacles Summit Trek, which takes three days and 
         involves ropes, ladders, and an arduous walk through the jungle.
       </p>
     </li>  

     <li id="subpoint">Penang Hill</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        The top of Penang Hill can be reached via the Penang Hill Railway, an air-conditioned funicular that makes the 2
        ,007-meter-long climb up in five to 10 minutes. Although there are mid-stops between the base station and the
         highest point, these are done only on request and mostly used by residents who live at those stops.
       </p>
       <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/hill.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
       <p id="s-desc">
        The top of Penang Hill offers beautiful green views over the city and is home to the Habitat Penang Hill, with a 
        1.6-kilometer nature trail cutting through the rain forest and a number of tropical gardens; a canopy walk 40 meters
         up in the sky; ziplines; and the Skyway, which offers three viewing decks and a 360-degree view of the bay and 
         islands.
