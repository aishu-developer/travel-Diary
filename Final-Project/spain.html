     <li id="subpoint">Bilbao</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        Bilbao was best known as an important seaport and industrial city in northern Spain until the construction of an 
        architectural marvel in the 1990s known as the Guggenheim Museum. Since then, this capital city of Vizcaya has 
        experienced a boom in tourism, promoting economic growth and revitalization of its many hidden gems, making it a
        popular destination.Celebrated as one of the most important architectural works of its time, the Guggenheim 
        Museum now shines as Bilbao’s city symbol. Devoted to modern and contemporary art, this giant complex of 
        interconnecting buildings presents a massive work of abstract sculpture that suggests a maritime theme with its 
        simulation of ship outlines and shimmering fish scales.

        architecture. Like the rest of the city, they are built out of sandstone. It is these warm hues that lend Salamanca

        of the traditional pilgrimage known as Camino de Santiago. Also called the Way of St. James, this pilgrimage dates
