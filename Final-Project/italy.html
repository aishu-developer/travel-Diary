   <h1 class="h2-desc">BEAUTIFUL ITALY</h1>
   <p class="desc">
     New places rank as high on travelers' bucket lists as Italy. Whatever your taste in travel, you'll satisfy it in 
     this country that is at once exotic and familiar. History, art, food, music, architecture, culture, sacred sites, 
     charming villages, and stunning scenery are all around, and in an atmosphere that only the most confirmed curmudgeon 
     could fail to enjoy. Plan your trip with our list of the best places to visit in Italy.

   <ul class="cities">
     <li id="subpoint">Rome</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        Both for its history as the capital of much of Europe and for its present day role as one of Europe's most 
        vibrant cities, for most tourists traveling to Italy, Rome heads the list of places to visit. Relics of its 
        ancient glories—the Colosseum, the Forum, the Pantheon, the Appian Way, and the Palatine Hill—vie with the vast 
        riches of the Vatican as the top attractions.
       </p>
       <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/rome.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
        <p id="s-desc">
        But between the important sights like the Sistine Chapel and Michelangelo's Pieta, take time to enjoy the city 
        itself. Relax in the Borghese gardens; eat gelato on the Spanish Steps; explore the narrow streets of Trastevere; 
        window-shop on the Via Veneto; and toss a coin in Trevi Fountain, so you can return again and again. It will take 
        several trips to see it all.
       </p>
     </li>  

     <li id="subpoint">Florence</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        The showcase of the Italian Renaissance, Florence can at times seem like one giant art museum. The Duomo, the 
        Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, is a landmark of world architecture, topped by its gravity-defying massive 
        dome. Together with its marble-inlaid bell tower by Giotto and its octagonal Baptistery with its incomparable 
        bronze doors by Ghiberti, this is one of the world's finest ensembles of Renaissance art.
       </p>
       <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/fl.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
       <p id="s-desc">
        Half a dozen art museums brim with paintings and sculpture, while more masterpieces decorate its churches. 
        Before you overdose on art in the Uffizi Gallery and Pitti Palace, stroll through the Boboli Gardens and explore 
        the artisans' studios and workshops of the Oltrarno, or shop for leather in Santa Croce.
       </p>
     </li>  

     <li id="subpoint">Venice</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        Who could fail to love a city whose streets are made of water, whose buses are boats, and where the songs of 
        gondoliers linger in the air? It is a magic city, and its major attraction to tourists is the city itself. 
        The hub of the city is the broad Piazza San Marco, St. Mark's Square, surrounded by several of its top tourist 
        attractions. The great Basilica of St. Mark stands beside the Doge's Palace, and overlooking both is the tall 
        Campanile.
       </p>
       <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/ven.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
       <p id="s-desc">
        Gondolas congregate at the end of the plaza in the Grand Canal, and in the other direction, a gate under the 
        clock tower leads into a warren of narrow, winding passageways, where you're sure to get lost on the way to 
        Rialto Bridge. But getting lost is one of the greatest pleasures of Venice, where a postcard scene awaits 
        around each corner.
       </p>
     </li>  

     <li id="subpoint">Tuscan Hill Towns</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        The undulating landscape of Tuscany is crowned by stone towns whose foundations go back to the Etruscans. Each 
        sits atop a hill, and many still have the castles and towers that once defended their commanding positions.It's 
        difficult to choose one above the others, as each has its own architecture, art, character, and story to tell. 
        Fairly bristling with towers and enclosed in walls that are largely intact, San Gimignano looks much as it did 
        in the Middle Ages, when it was an important stop on the pilgrims' route to Rome. Volterra was an important 
        Etruscan center before the Romans came and still has remains of both civilizations today. The tourist attractions
         of Arezzo are the legacy of the many artists, architects, and poets who lived there.
       </p>
       <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/tus.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
       <p id="s-desc">
        Like Volterra, walled Cortona was an Etruscan settlement and later a Roman one, but adds reminders of its 
        Florentine past as well. Cortona is one of Italy's oldest towns. The proximity of these hill towns to the cities 
        of Florence, Siena, Pisa, and Luca fills Tuscany with a concentration of many of the best places to visit in 
        Italy.
       </p>
     </li>  

     <li id="subpoint"> Milan</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        Although Milan is a major entry point for tourists because of its airport, it's often overlooked as a destination 
        of its own. That's a shame, because Milan has one of the highest concentration of artistic and architectural 
        attractions in all Italy, and for those interested in design and fashion (not to mention shopping), it's a must. 
        Milan has been the home and work place for luminaries in all these fields: Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Verdi, 
        Enrico Caruso, Toscanini, and designer Giorgio Armani.
       </p>
       <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/mil.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
       <p id="s-desc">
        Il Duomo, Milan's massive cathedral, is among the world's most magnificent churches, and finest example of the 
        Flamboyant Gothic style. La Scala is the world's most prestigious opera house, Da Vinci's The Last Supper fills 
        the wall at a monastery, and throughout the city are museums and palaces filled with some of the world's finest art.
         And no fashionista can resist a stroll through the famed Quadrilatero.
       </p>
     </li>  

     <li id="subpoint">Lake Como</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        Italy's most beautiful lake, Como has been the favorite summer retreat of the rich and famous since ancient Romans 
        fled Milan's summer heat to cool off in villas along its steep shores. Later villas decorate its tightly clustered 
        towns, especially pretty Bellagio, artfully set on a point where the three narrow arms of the lake meet.
       </p>
       <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/como.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
       <p id="s-desc">
        A microclimate makes Como's western shore temperate even in winter, so the white peaks of the Alps just to the north 
        can be viewed between palm trees and camellias. Don't overlook the town of Como, on the southern shore, well worth 
        a stop before boarding a steamer to explore the lake.
       </p>
     </li>  

     <li id="subpoint">Amalfi Coast and Capri</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        The high, precipitous Amalfi Peninsula juts sharply into the Mediterranean just south of Naples, forming the southern rim 
        of Naples Bay. It's hard to imagine a more beautiful—or unlikely setting for the towns that spill down its steep 
        slopes. Streets in most are stairways, and houses seem glued to the cliffs behind them. Flowers bloom everywhere, 
        and below the towns are beaches caught in coves of emerald water.
       </p>
       <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/coast.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
       <p id="s-desc">
        The Amalfi Drive, along the southern coast, is one of the world's great scenic routes. Off the end of the 
        peninsula, and easy to reach by regular ferries, is the fabled island of Capri, with its Blue Grotto sea cave, 
        lavish villas, and lush gardens. Sorrento, on the northern coast of the Amalfi Peninsula is a good base, an 
        easy day trip from all the things to see and do in the region.
       </p>
     </li>  

     <li id="subpoint">The Cinque Terre</li>
       <p id="s-desc">
        The five towns that cling to the steep, rocky Mediterranean coast north of La Spezia were almost impossible 
        to reach by land until the railway connected them by tunneling through the headlands that separate them. Today, 
        the trail along the cliffs that locals once used to travel from town to town is one of Italy's great hikes; 
        the shortest and widest of its sections, between Manarola and Riomaggiore is known as the Via dell'Amore.
       </p>
       <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/terre.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
       <p id="s-desc">
        Riomaggiore and Vernazza, with their narrow streets dropping down to tiny rock-bound harbors are the most 
        filled with character, and despite its recent popularity with tourists, the Cinque Terre remains one of Italy's 
        most appealing attractions.
