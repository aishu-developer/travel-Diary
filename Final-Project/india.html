      Bollywood actors. Tourists are never far from five-star hotels or gourmet restaurants in this luxe city. And even if those activities are out of

      <p id="s-desc">
      You can also see a more authentic, local side of Mumbai in the bustling "Thieves Market" or at the Churchgate railway station, where hundreds
      of thousands of homemade lunches are packed up for delivery to the city's office workers every day.Make sure you devote a day to checking out 
      Sanjay Gandhi National Park and exploring the 2,000-year-old Kanheri Cave carvings.
      </p>

    <li id="subpoint">Rajasthan</li>
      <p id="s-desc">
      Translated to "Land of Kings," Rajasthan brims with remnants of the kings and queens of past centuries. Between its glittering palaces, stately
      forts,and lively festivals, this western state deserves a starring role in your trip to India.
      </p>
      <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/ra.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
      <p id="s-desc">
       Jaipur, part of the Golden Triangle Tourist Circuit, which also includes Agra and New Delhi, is one of the top places to visit in Rajasthan. 
       Dubbed "The Paris of India," it's known for its characteristic pink buildings, lavish City Palace, and jewelry stores galore.
      </p>
      
      <p id="s-desc">
      The "Blue City," Jodhpur, offers tourists an equally unforgettable experience in its hilltop Mehrangarh Fort.Udaipur oozes romance with its flower-lined
      streets and fantastic City Palace Complex, where the royal family still lives today.And Jaisalmer looks like an Arabian Nights fairy tale brought to life,
      with its yellow sandstone structures and historic havelis (mansions). No matter where you end up in this desert state, you'll be captivated by the magic
      of Rajasthan.
      </p>

    <li id="subpoint">Rishikesh</li>   
    <p id="s-desc">
    Rishikesh has been on the radar for spiritually minded travelers since the late 1960s, when the Beatles spent time in Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram—now an abandoned 
    site that has become an off-the-beaten-path tourist attraction for fans.
    </p>
    <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/ri.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
    <p id="s-desc">
    The town is nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas on the banks of the holy Ganges River, and serves as a center for yoga and pilgrimages. Take part in the action,
    or just enjoy the sounds of the temple bells and sightseeing from Rishikesh's two suspension bridges, often guarded by assertive families of monkeys. Keep your distance.
    </p>

    <li id="subpoint">Varanasi</li>  
    <p id="s-desc">
    One of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world, Varanasi is arguably the holiest place in India. The spiritual activities take place along the sacred 
    Ganges River, where pilgrims bathe and mourners cremate recently deceased relatives in plain view of passersby.
    </p> 
    <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/varanasi.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
    <p id="s-desc">
     Tourists, on the other hand, find their own flavor of spiritualism taking sunrise boat rides, releasing floral blessings that float on the river, and watching the 
     fire-filled Hindu chanting ceremonies from the steep ghats.
    </p>

    <p id="s-desc">
    Away from the water, the streets of the old town twist and turn like an endless maze. Legend has it that there's still no accurate map of Varanasi, and once you
    experience the labyrinthine city for yourself, you'll be inclined to believe it.
    </p>

    <li id="subpoint">Amritsar</li>   
     <p id="s-desc">
     Amritsar, the "Jewel of Punjab," has made its claim to fame with its remarkable Golden Temple. One of the holiest places in the world for Sikhs, the gilded 
     structure is a sight to behold, glistening in the sun and reflecting into the large pool that surrounds it.
    </p>
    <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/amritsar.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
    <p id="s-desc">
    The attraction also boasts the world's largest community kitchen, which serves 100,000 diners (including curious tourists!) lentils and curries every day.
    While in Amritsar, plan to spend an afternoon at the border of Pakistan to see the Beating Retreat Ceremony. Goose-stepping guards from long-term rivals 
    India and Pakistan open and close the border gates at dusk in an over-the-top ceremony you'll never forget. Get there early to dance to blaring Bollywood 
    music with locals in the streets.
    </p>

    <li id="subpoint">Goa</li>
     <p id="s-desc">
     India's not just full of big cities and holy sites—it also has incredible beaches down south in Goa. Its stretches of golden sand along the Arabian Sea offer
     something for every type of tourist, whether you're interested in hanging out with the backpacker crowd in laid-back beach huts or having a ritzy tropical get
     away at a five-star resort.
    </p>
    <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/goa.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
    <p id="s-desc">
    One unique part of Goa is its blend of Indian and Portuguese cultures. You'll experience the fusion throughout the destination, from its Baroque architecture 
    and cathedrals to its spicy vindaloo curries and seafood dishes.
    </p>
  
  <li id="subpoint">Kerala</li>
   <p id="s-desc">
   Head south of Goa, and you'll trade beaches for tranquil backwaters in Kerala. Nothing beats the experience of hopping aboard a traditional thatched-top houseboat
   in Alleppey (also known as Alappuzha) and slowly floating through palm-fringed lagoons and rivers, either as a day trip or overnight adventure. You'll enjoy freshly
   cooked Indian cuisine on the water and breathtakingly beautiful natural sights and wildlife.
   </P>
   <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/kerala.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
   <p id="s-desc">
   Easygoing Kerala is like a breath of fresh air from the intensity of cities like New Delhi and Jaipur up north. Schedule some time here when you're in need of a 
   break from the chaos.
   </P>

  <li id="subpoint">Kolkata</li>
  <p id="s-desc">
  India's third-largest city, Kolkata, is a decaying masterpiece of former British India, brimming with colonial-era architecture. The top things to do in Kolkata include 
  seeing the Victoria Memorial, a white marble monument that features a museum with dozens of galleries, and Park Street, a famous thoroughfare with shops and restaurants 
  that bustle 24/7, especially during the holidays.
   </P>
   <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/kolkata.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
   <p id="s-desc">
   But Kolkata is as much about the sites as it is about the emotions. This is a city that will somehow induce every one of your emotions with the highs and lows of life
   taking place in plain view on every street. Brace yourself, and be open to the experience.
   </P>

  <li id="subpoint">Ajanta and Ellora Caves</li>
  <p id="s-desc">
  Time travel isn't a reality for travelers quite yet, but you can get pretty close at the Ajanta and Ellora Caves in Maharashtra. Both UNESCO World Heritage
  Sites, the caves feature intricate carvings from at least 1,500 years ago.
   </P>
   <img src="C:/Users/sai/Desktop/HTML-learning/Final-Project/aji.jpg" alt="Homepage image" width="100%" height="600" />
   
   <p id="s-desc">
   The Ajanta Caves are the oldest of the two attractions, featuring around 30 Buddhist cave monuments cut into the rock as far back as the 2nd century BC.
   </P>

   <p id="s-desc">
   Around 100 kilometers southwest, the Ellora Caves contain nearly three dozen Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu carvings, the most famous of which is the Kailasa Temple (Cave 16),
   a massive structure devoted to Lord Shiva that features life-size elephant sculptures. The magnificent carvings at both sites will leave you filled with wonder.
